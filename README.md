# Bash Shell Script Database Management System (DBMS)

## Project Overview
This project is a simple **Database Management System (DBMS)** implemented using Bash shell scripting. It allows users to **store** and **retrieve** data directly from the hard disk via a command-line interface (CLI). The DBMS uses directories and files to represent databases and tables, providing an easy-to-use menu-driven interface for database operations.
